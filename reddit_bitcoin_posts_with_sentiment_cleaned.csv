PSA: I lost nearly all my bitcoin by mining bitcoin,2024-05-13 16:30:27,"On August 2021 I spent exactly 1 BTC on 6 Antminer S19j Pros. These were state-of-the art miners that cost $7,500 each, and were hosted with Compass Mining, which sources warehouses with cheap electricity ($0.06 kw/h which gradually increased to $0.08 kw/h).

As of today, these miners are no longer profitable to run. These miners are now worth $500 each (0.05 BTC for 6) which means I lost .95 BTC on the hardware cost.

Electricity for the miners was paid each month with the bitcoin mined. Of the .9 BTC mined between 2021 and today, .7 BTC went to electricity costs. This means in 3 years, the miners only made .2 BTC of profit.

So my initial investment of 1 BTC has resulted in .2 BTC of revenue and .05 BTC worth of hardware. I only have .25 BTC to show for all of this, a loss of 75%.

Please do not make the mistake I did, you are infinitely better off just buying and holding bitcoin than by trying to mine it. **The bottom line is bitcoin mining is subsidized by fiat loans, companies can absolutely make a profit in fiat terms by taking out loans to buy miners, but by spending bitcoin on miners directly the depreciation of the hardware will make it so you never, ever make a return in bitcoin.**

Right now an Antminer S21 costs 0.09 BTC and will net you 0.001-0.002 BTC a month after electricity costs. With a break even time of 4-7 years at the current hash rate (and hash rate only gets exponentially higher over time), you will never, ever make your bitcoin back.",0.8405,Positive

I am 24 and I wanted to say that I have been buying Bitcoin for over 2 years now. I worked while my friends were in party holiday. I worked unhealthy much only for Bitcoin. 

5 months ago I unfortunately (because of hype) bought two altcoins and day by day I asked myself ""why?"". Bitcoin went up more and my altcoins not. I think Bitcoin is and will forever be the monetary black hole.

Why should I risk my BTC for possibly more, but possibly less, I have honestly asked myself daily?

Today, 15 minutes ago, I sold them all.

Not only that: Today I sold my old car as well which I was driving when I was 18 years old.

Everything went into BTC.

I will buy everyday and hodl no matter what's coming. 

Thanks for your time reading it.

Yours sincerely,

a young Bitcoiner

TIL: there used to be a Bitcoin faucet that literally gave away 5 bitcoins just to solve a CAPTCHA,2022-09-04 22:53:55,"12 years ago in 2010 a fellow named Gavin Andresen created the first cryptocurrency faucet;  he made this simple website giving away 5 bitcoin ( not a typo FIVE)  just for solving a CAPTCHA.  It has since been archived and what is crazy was that the snapshot on that day showed that there was still 750 Bitcoin to give away.  5 Bitcoin is basically 100,000 USD in todays price and at its all time high this would had equate to 325,000 just for visiting a website.

From wikipedia source: Gavin Andresen is a bitcoin pioneer and was one of the few developers that actually developed alongside with Satoshi Nakamoto who declared him as the lead developer for the client bitcoin software.  Been quoted,  ""Bitcoin is designed to bring us back to a decentralized currency of the people,"" and ""this is like better gold than gold.""  He also conceived of the Bitcoin Foundation but sadly he stopped contributing in 2016 and criticize bitcoin developers for not increasing network capacity and later got involved in bitcoin cash instead. 

Anyways thought I shared a bit of fun history to lighten up the mood a bit.

I'm a software engineer who has spent the last 6 months developing payment processing services for Bitcoin and other crypto assets. I've had the pleasure of exploring and learning about how blockchain works, how transactions work, and its security at a deep level. Most importantly I've learned about just how much utility Bitcoin has to offer.

As I hear about more services, companies, and now countries are adopting Bitcoin, it's very clear that it's here to stay. But most importantly it's already started to begin reaching the ""soccer mom"" audience. People ""use"" Bitcoin, not just as an investment, or a get rich quick scheme. They use it to barter, pay bills, trade, and as a means of exchange for goods and services.

I don't just see Bitcoin as a chart in an app. I don't see Bitcoin as something you buy with USD. I see Bitcoin as Bitcoin. It's a currency in its own right, with value dictinct from USD and others. And given a decade, or two. I see it as the global currency for the future of all transactions.

Thanks for hearing my points.

Edit: A notice to those saying I'm making a mistake. I have no debt and if this money were to vanish tomorrow I'd be sad, but by no means will I lose my house, go hungry, lose medical coverage, or anything like that. I believe in Bitcoin as a primary currency and store of value, and want to hold my savings in Bitcoin.

Additionally, the US has a currency (USD), Japan has a currency (JPY), Canada has a currency (CAD), yet it's far fetched to believe the internet can't have a currency (BTC)?

It's like an elegant clock set into motion that continues to tick. There's no promise of some complex protocol to come 3, 5, or 10 years down the road. It does what it's supposed to now without self promotion from the founders. Since it doesn't need self promotion to thrive, it doesn't fall victim to the vices of marketing from greedy, charismatic leaders, with overly complex projects. Sure, there's Saylor and Novogratz that sometimes fall into that role. But bitcoin doesn't need them to survive and won't need them when they die. The project works now. It does what it's supposed to and it'll continue to do what it's supposed to. It's the money of the future of our science fiction novels.

There's no Krypto Kris marketing shitty debit cards. There's no charismatic Do Kwon doing a Forbes, Steve Jobs photo shoot with a black t-shirt and a white background. There's no J Powell magically expanding the money supply with a cobol fueled wand, creating a 9 trillion USD balance sheet out of thin air.

BTC takes out the corruption of humans, because the humans that created it stepped away. Sure, people will build corrupt systems around it, but BTC itself is a simple, pure, and elegant vehicle silently ticking away in the background until the ticking becomes so loud that no one can ignore it.",-0.7668,Negative

"Evidence that the mods of /r/Bitcoin may have been involved with the hacking and vote manipulation ""attack"" on /r/Bitcoin.",2017-11-21 15:25:58,"
While running the Censorship Notifier Bot, we generally try to stay out of any specific situations regarding any subreddits we monitor. But the very nature of the CNBot requires it to collect and store large amounts of data, and requires us to be aware of normal trends within a subreddit to ensure the bot is running correctly. Specifically, the bot needs to know exactly what was on the site at a specific time, and when things disappear from the site. This data positions us to diligently analyze events and check real data as we go. When we first began looking at the massive downvoting attack as shown in [BashCo's previously stickied thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/i_just_got_257_downvotes_in_8_minutes_for_calling) last week, the first thing we noticed was that both of the bot-voted comments ( [Image of #1](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/-/dpto887/?depth=1), link [to #2](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/-/dptpngb/?depth=1) ) would normally trigger our censorship notifier detection. Both ""censoring"" and ""censorship"" are trigger words we have found triggering automatic removal, something we later confirmed again. This would imply that either the comments were explicitly approved by the moderators at that time, or our understanding of the subreddit's policies needed updating. We began to dig into the data available, and those findings lead us to the conclusion that we must publish what we had found. **Note:** All times are in UTC; Some references are moved to the end of the document, tagged as [REF-1], [REF-2], etc.


# Overview


We'll start out by giving a rough picture of the events that transpired. The bots which were downvoting comments and posts on /r/Bitcoin and upvoting posts on /r/btc began their attack on 11/14/2017 at around 18:00 utc. A similar unusual pattern of voting appeared on /r/btc around the same time the day before, though less dramatically. The bots seemed to be [pushing people to buy Bitcoin Cash](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7cp4v0/buy_bitcoin_cash_right_now_youre_gonna_regret_it/) in such a blatant way that it even left a [bad taste in the mouths of Bitcoin Cash supporters](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7cp4v0/buy_bitcoin_cash_right_now_youre_gonna_regret_it/dprled0/). Both the attack the day before and the /r/Bitcoin bot voting attack on 11/14/2017 ended before or around 22:00 utc [REF-3]. The bots attacking /r/Bitcoin upvoted posts complaining about high fees and downvoted about 30 other /r/Bitcoin posts. At the same time they upvoted posts on /r/btc. We identified 65 comments downvoted by bots in /r/Bitcoin and 2 upvoted. The conclusions appeared to indicate that the bots were promoting Bitcoin Cash and /r/btc and harming /r/Bitcoin.


# Suspicious comment #1


We began investigating into the comments that caught our eye at first, referred to as [[CU-1]](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/i_just_got_257_downvotes_in_8_minutes_for_calling/dpto05x/?depth=1) and [[CU-2]](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/-/dptpngb/?depth=1) for short. [CU-1]'s [content can be seen](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/-/dpto887/?depth=1) here as it originally looked. Immediately we noticed the next oddity - How were people able to see votes in /r/Bitcoin to discuss voting in the first place? /r/Bitcoin has blocked votes [from being visible](http://archive.is/kigsu) on comments during discussion for years. When did that change? We found that it changed right before [CU-1] was posted. BashCo stickied a comment stating they would ""[pull back the curtains](http://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/-/dptn609?depth=1)"" at 20:49, and archive.org confirmed that scores became visible between [20:32 utc](https://archive.is/VcYfO) and [20:50 utc](http://archive.is/uh8fs). That, oddly enough, was just 13 minutes before [CU-1] was posted at 21:02:25.


We have determined that [CU-1] was indeed blocked by /r/Bitcoin's automoderator rules as we expected. The [screenshot taken](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/-/dpto887/?depth=1) by /r/Bitcoin moderator StopAndDecrypt clearly shows this, as the [""moderator approved"" checkmark is present](https://imgur.com/pXkH7Jv). We also tested automoderator rules with an aged account with karma and confirmed that ""censors"" and ""censoring"" were both blocked [REF-1]. Note that the poster, darwin2500 (under control of hacker, please don't ping them; they aren't a Bitcoiner) could not have been an ""approved submitter"" - they seem to have only had [one comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/75vjl0/btc_breaks_5000/doa16nz/) in /r/Bitcoin before the hacking. So why was the comment manually approved? We are not aware of any other approved or allowed comments that blatantly reference censorship like that in the last several months. The obvious answer is that after ""pulling back the curtain"" and making votes visible, the /r/Bitcoin mods wanted to give people an opportunity to see this voting manipulation in action.


Except this idea did not hold up. We found 10 similar comments from the same time period which were not approved or were explicitly removed unlike [CU-1]. Some of these were uncannily similar to the original comment. For example [this one](https://np.reddit.com/r/noncensored_bitcoin/comments/7cyuxo/uncensoredrbitcoin_i_just_got_257_downvotes_in_8/dptum4o/) was submitted 8 minutes after [CU-1] and never approved. Another [here supported neither subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/noncensored_bitcoin/comments/7cyuxo/uncensoredrbitcoin_i_just_got_257_downvotes_in_8/dpuc7bx/) and was blocked at 21:48 and never approved. [This one accused](https://np.reddit.com/r/noncensored_bitcoin/comments/7cyuxo/uncensoredrbitcoin_i_just_got_257_downvotes_in_8/dptu3ps/) /r/Bitcoin mods of being paid by Blockstream and was manually removed at ~22:35. A fourth [was identical to](https://np.reddit.com/r/noncensored_bitcoin/comments/7cyuxo/uncensoredrbitcoin_i_just_got_257_downvotes_in_8/dptzspb/) [CU-2] and blocked at 00:12 and never approved. The same account of [CU-1] submitted [a second comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/noncensored_bitcoin/comments/7cyuxo/uncensoredrbitcoin_i_just_got_257_downvotes_in_8/dptot0v/) 5 minutes after [CU-1] and was blocked and not approved. The other 5 things blocked or removed around the same time were: [[1]](https://np.reddit.com/r/noncensored_bitcoin/comments/7cyhia/uncensoredrbitcoin_attack_continues_on_bitcoin/dptlkwu/) [[2]](https://np.reddit.com/r/noncensored_bitcoin/comments/7cyr0g/uncensoredrbitcoin_21_hours_still_zero/dptnvih/) [[3]](https://np.reddit.com/r/noncensored_bitcoin/comments/7cynma/uncensoredrbitcoin_bitcoin_cash_blocktimes_are/) [[4]](https://np.reddit.com/r/noncensored_bitcoin/comments/7cyr0g/uncensoredrbitcoin_21_hours_still_zero/dptukye/) [[5]](https://np.reddit.com/r/noncensored_bitcoin/comments/7cyhia/uncensoredrbitcoin_attack_continues_on_bitcoin/dptwe4b/). The existence or absence of most of these comments around the claimed time can be verified independently of the censorship_notifier, see [REF-2]


But the why wasn't the only oddity. [CU-1] was submitted, approved, upvoted, and screenshotted all in less than 180 seconds, as shown by [its screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/X75XhJG.png) (""2 minutes"" rounds down on Reddit). That is an extremely short time for an automoderated comment to be approved based on what we have observed and in checking other subreddits open modlogs on approvals. Perhaps the moderators were very snappy about approving comments within this particular thread? Once again, this idea did not hold up. [This comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/-/dptocyw) appears to have been manually approved as it wasn't seen [until the third scan](https://imgur.com/Y52ER6o) after its supposed creation, ~11 minutes of delay. Perhaps only when the comment was a direct reply to BashCo? Still no - [Here's a comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/-/dptpcw4) that was a direct reply to BashCo, but [didn't show up in scans](https://imgur.com/GMYw9fK) for 45 minutes. Here specifically the our data can be independently checked - [This snapshot](https://archive.is/88aXe) does not show the comment, but [this one](https://archive.is/MDa7O) does.


Despite all the comments being blocked or removed as normal that we found, what we did not find was any other examples of anti-r/Bitcoin comments approved or allowed ***except the comments the bots upvoted***. Three snapshots([[1]](https://archive.is/nngZQ) [[2]](http://archive.is/APpsJ) [[3]](https://archive.is/88aXe)) of the thread in question show no other strongly anti-r/Bitcoin comments present except [CU-1] and [CU-2]; Why did the moderators specifically allow [CU-1] and [CU-2] and nothing else? Perhaps they wanted to reveal the voting patterns, but then why only those comments? Further, by the time of [CU-1], the bot had not upvoted any comments at all. Why would the moderators assume that particular comment and *no others* would be upvoted, a mere 13 minutes after they ""pulled back the curtain?""


In addition to the data we're referenced, our claims about the moderation of [CU-1] can be verified by either the admins or any current moderators of /r/Bitcoin, as moderator log events cannot be deleted. If anyone sends us an image of the moderator who approved this comment(preferably with full HH:MM:SS timestamp!) we will add the image to this post and keep their identity anonymous.


# How did the bots pick targets?


The next thing we investigated was the behavior of the bots during the ""attack"". How many posts and comments did they downvote? How many did they upvote? What did they pick and were there any obvious correlations? We initially identified only two posts inside /r/Bitcoin that were upvoted by the bots - Both being posts about long delays on the OP's transaction confirmations. The [first post](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cwpme/transaction_still_not_confirmed/) was removed by moderators but otherwise no one seemed to notice the sudden upvotes. The [second post upvoted](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cy430/21_hours_still_zero_confirmations/) on the other hand had [users commenting](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cy430/21_hours_still_zero_confirmations/dptiws5/) on the upvotes within 8 minutes of it being posted and had several comments downvoted within it by the bots. Generally (but not always) the targets of the bots got 200-250 votes, either up or down [REF-3]. Even before the moderators of /r/Bitcoin revealed comment scores, users were [commenting on the obviousness](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cy430/21_hours_still_zero_confirmations/dptiws5/) of the downvotes (edits). We found images from hacked users which showed what posts the bots chose to upvote and downvote, which further helped us identify as many of the posts as possible [REF-4] [REF-5].


The comments upvoted, too, were specifically chosen. Both comments upvoted were ones [attacking /r/Bitcoin over censorship](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/-/dpto887/?depth=1), and without [any subtlety](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/-/dptpngb/?depth=1). Both comments were in the primary stickied thread with most of the comment downvotes. We quickly determined that the account that posted [CU-1] was under the control of the hacker, something [other users](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/i_just_got_257_downvotes_in_8_minutes_for_calling/dptpdno/) also concluded. [CU-2] was posted by a clear /r/Bitcoin supporter based on history. Both comments used words that /r/Bitcoin's automod rules normally silently block [REF-1]. Other comments that subtly denigrated the subreddit's policies were noticed by the bot - but were [***downvoted*** *instead of upvoted*](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/i_just_got_257_downvotes_in_8_minutes_for_calling/dptnx5a).  Why?


The comments and posts chosen for downvoting were all over the place. Many of the comments chosen for downvoting seems to have been simply ""because they were there in the thread"" - For example [every single comment visible](https://archive.is/nngZQ) in before 20:50 was downvoted. BashCo was targeted more than any other user(8 comments), but the bot generally didn't seem to focus on specific users. The vast majority of comments downvoted(54/65) happened in the stickied post, with 6 more happening in the [second upvoted](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cy430/21_hours_still_zero_confirmations/) post. The remaining 5 comments downvoted were scattered across 4 different posts [REF-3]. The bot specifically went after comments and posts talking about downvotes, the accounts hack, or the attack itself [REF-5] but they also downvoted [neutral posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cxek6/billionaire_investor_novogratz_institutional/). The voting seemed to come almost exclusively in waves targeting one thing at a time, which made the bot votes obvious to anyone who was looking for them - which people were, since many posts targeted [were about](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cy92u/my_votes_are_being_manipulated/) the downvotes.


We also noticed that an extremely high number of /r/Bitcoin and /r/btc users were reporting that they themselves were hacked and part of the bot attack. We identified [35 such users](https://pastebin.com/ADN7Qg0E), but the highest number of votes seen on a single thing indicate between 250-300 accounts involved with the attack. Over 10% of the hacked users were Bitcoiners, what are the chances of that? Well, Reddit has (very) roughly 50 million accounts, and the CN database indicates that about ~50k are regular or semi-regular /r/Bitcoin and /r/btc users, which is 1/1000th. 35 / 300 of hacked users being regular Bitcoin users and feeling the need to post about it is > 1/10th. Whoever was running this bot seems to have intentionally chosen Bitcoin users - It seems like they **wanted** the hacked users to see the results of the hack.


The result of all of this was that many many people commented on the blatantness of the voting, with [many of them](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/i_just_got_257_downvotes_in_8_minutes_for_calling/dpugpdb/) suspicious as to why anyone [would do such](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/i_just_got_257_downvotes_in_8_minutes_for_calling/dptvqr7/?depth=1) a blatant attack. More examples: [[1]](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7d4sj8/false_flags_vote_manipulation_and_trolls/dpv22ps/) [[2]](https://np.reddit.com/r/noncensored_bitcoin/comments/7cyuxo/uncensoredrbitcoin_i_just_got_257_downvotes_in_8/dpu00fs/) [[3]](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/i_just_got_257_downvotes_in_8_minutes_for_calling/dpuec87/) [[4]](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/i_just_got_257_downvotes_in_8_minutes_for_calling/dpttuzs/?depth=2) [[5]](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/i_just_got_257_downvotes_in_8_minutes_for_calling/dptsq0q/) [[6]](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/i_just_got_257_downvotes_in_8_minutes_for_calling/dpu5c49/) [[7]](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/i_just_got_257_downvotes_in_8_minutes_for_calling/dptpbxn/) [[8]](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/i_just_got_257_downvotes_in_8_minutes_for_calling/dptnh2d/) [[9]](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/i_just_got_257_downvotes_in_8_minutes_for_calling/dpv2dbj/).  Amidst all of this there was one exception so subtle that we almost missed it - There were two posts voted on that ran completely contrary to the rest of the behavior of the bot. The first image showed upvotes on [a pro-/r/Bitcoin](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cnihn) post [""PSA: Attack on Bitcoin""](https://i.imgur.com/ES2AV5br.png) thread and a downvote for the anti-/r/Bitcoin [""awkward meme orgy""](https://i.imgur.com/qPPebBv.png) /r/btc [thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7cntb5/since_you_cannot_debate_anything_without_getting/). At first we thought maybe this was a legitimate vote by [this user](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/i_just_got_257_downvotes_in_8_minutes_for_calling/dpu3uqc/?context=2) mixed in with bot votes, but archive.org showed us that indeed that /r/btc thread got [a sudden wave](http://archive.is/nfkeQ) of downvotes in [less than 23 minutes](http://archive.is/Gsrjj). Perhaps the bot forgot which side it was pushing for? But both changes were subtle and not noticed by any users as far as we can tell.


The final thing the bot did as far as we have identified was to upvote [CU-2], and then the attack seems to have stopped suddenly. That comment [wasn't upvoted](https://archive.is/88aXe) until [21:55 - 22:05](https://archive.is/fkmqN). So what about that comment? Why was that the only comment not under its own control upvoted, and why did the attack stop suddenly afterwards?


# Suspicious comment #2


The CN database gave us some hints. Both the [CU-2] and [this comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/noncensored_bitcoin/comments/7cyuxo/uncensoredrbitcoin_i_just_got_257_downvotes_in_8/dptot0v/) were deleted by the user, likely when they took back control over their hacked account. [CU-1] was deleted at 21:23 +/- 1 minute, ~21 minutes after creation [REF-6], and not present [in that snapshot](http://archive.is/APpsJ). The votebot operator probably didn't expect this to happen so quickly. After that deletion there [was no obvious](http://archive.is/APpsJ) comment showing their upvotes on the thread, and there were no obvious choices to choose from. It seems that they wanted a comment that wouldn't vanish, so not a hacked account, and also that they preferred a comment that could ultimately be used to make /r/btc look guilty.


[4n4n4's comment [CU-2]](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/-/dptpngb/?depth=1) provided exactly this, and it was posted to the thread ~5 minutes after [CU-1] was deleted - at 21:28. [CU-2] was never blocked by automoderator, it was picked up in the next CN scan ~1 minute later... Seemingly because 4n4n4 is an approved submitter. They have a long history of pro-/r/Bitcoin comments; we [archived 5 pages](https://archive.is/kyvg5) of comments. The moderators left the comment in place and the bot didn't touch it [for at least](https://archive.is/88aXe) 27 minutes. With the similarities listed above, [CU-2] made the ideal next target for the bot's upvoting. Almost immediately after it did so, 4n4n4 screenshotted, [archived,](https://archive.is/fkmqN) and edited the comment. And then the bot's voting attack instantly ceased as far as we can tell [REF-3] [REF-5].


But 4n4n4 was not a hacked account. So who is 4n4n4?


# So who posted that?


We have a surprisingly large amount of evidence indicating that 4n4n4 is /u/nullc, the CTO of Blockstream.


The biggest indicator we found is that nullc has the very frequent pattern-- of writing--his sentences with [two dashes](https://imgur.com/A2wz071) separating words. This by itself is somewhat rare, though we confirmed that he uses it [more times than anyone else](https://imgur.com/JPNZPZy) in the CN database, the [much more unusual](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/79ih3o/just_visited_rbtc_wtf/dp2e8oa/) habit is using two dashes [with no spaces](https://imgur.com/awD5FhU) on [either side](https://archive.is/MEB6T). The CN database [stored 860,000 comments](https://imgur.com/FQhpjuW) for us to compare with, and very quickly confirmed the similarities between the two. His history is littered with examples, but we also used the [bitcoin-dev email list](https://imgur.com/9wEcp0a) to confirm [the unusual](https://imgur.com/LXIPpoO) habit. [Like 4n4n4](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/79ih3o/just_visited_rbtc_wtf/dp2e8oa/), nullc also has examples of using [this--specific](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-May/007880.html) pattern twice in one sentence, which was extremely rare in our searches.


But there were many more things we noticed. We found [several examples](https://archive.is/wcNiD) of 4n4n4 picking up [nullc's conversations](http://archive.is/fvQvQ) and [continuing them](http://archive.is/MZ5Og ). One such case was 4n4n4's [third comment ever](https://archive.is/FS6Rx). 4n4n4 also [referenced](http://archive.is/ejiP7) many of [nullc's writings](http://archive.is/x7R3i) and [posts](http://archive.is/tEuWa). 4n4n4 referenced [this code change](http://archive.is/5u2pu) that [originated from](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10618) nullc [multiple times](http://archive.is/eMHWw). 4n4n4's [CU-2] comment edit used the words [""rbtc playbook,""](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7cyj7o/-/dptpngb/?depth=1) something our database confirmed was [extremely rare](https://imgur.com/Q1CRUop) but is a saying [nullc likes](http://archive.is/51TUB).


And that was just the beginning:


1. Very knowledgable [about](http://archive.is/ko1Dy) Bitcoin Core [development](http://archive.is/h0YxO) & the history of the [scaling conflict](http://archive.is/OvI92).

2. 4n4n4 picked up a thread [after many replies](https://archive.is/LSxtA) by nullc arguing that [low fees and empty mempools](http://archive.is/0IWd0) are actually a **problem**.

3. Just [like nullc](http://archive.is/wyIrj), 4n4n4 [liked BIP148](http://archive.is/3NoZS) but did not ""support"" or ""endorse"" it.

4. Seems [to know](http://archive.is/js5Dn) an awful lot [about nullc's](http://archive.is/zsVgt) life.

5. Used the phrase [""Bitcoin's creator""](https://archive.is/aNZ55), a major nullc trait [previously documented](http://archive.is/WZu3d)

6. [Talks](http://archive.is/X8bYI) about [nullc](http://archive.is/8jVLw). A [lot.](http://archive.is/IEv42)

7. [Somehow knows](http://archive.is/YtmVT) who is [working on what](http://archive.is/2qfrJ) within Blockstream.

8. And even responded [directly to nullc](http://archive.is/THgKp) in support of a claim nullc had made [multiple times within that thread](http://archive.is/RvE9O)



# Conclusions


After the massive amount of research we put into this, we believe that at least one moderator of /r/Bitcoin must have been either aware of the bot's plans (and allowed it to place blame on others), or have executed the attack themselves. This is most likely the moderator who immediately approved the [CU-1] comment. Other moderators may or may not have been involved. Meaning, yes, we believe that a moderator of /r/Bitcoin either directed or was complicit in the hacking of many of their own Bitcoin Reddit user accounts.


We believe that it is likely that /u/4n4n4 aka /u/nullc was also aware of or involved in this attack based upon the suspicious timing and similarities of [CU-2]. A Core Developer of /u/nullc's experience would certainly have the technical abilities to pull off such an attack, but that is true of many others on both sides of the debate as well. Some users reported that the IP addresses the bots logged in from were vultr instances and that vultr 1) requires tracable payment methods like credit cards, and 2) takes an aggressive stance against abuse of their systems, so perhaps more information can come to light about this yet.


We encourage the Reddit admins to carefully review our claims and to validate them. If our claims here are true, surely some type of strong action is warranted. Please note that we have tried to make sure all of our links are archived, but they were archived under the www.reddit.com domain and **not** the np.reddit.com domain.


For any people who found this post helpful and want to tip us, **please** donate your tips to archive.is and archive.org (not us). Without those two amazing services none of this research would be possible.

Bitcoin Vs. Bitcoin Spot ETFs: the great illusion has started. Beware.,2024-01-12 09:31:42,"It is quite shocking to see that so many people have completely misunderstood Bitcoin in recent days and hours.

Or maybe these so-called Bitcoiners are finally revealing their true colors by showing that only greed has always guided them...

With the approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs, some even believe that the mass adoption of Bitcoin by the general public has started...

Unfortunately, this is not the case.

Even if these financial products are phenomenally successful, this will in no way mean that mass adoption has started for Bitcoin.

Bitcoin aims to free us from these intermediaries who abuse people's trust and make people pay fees that have no reason to be paid.

The mass adoption of these Bitcoin-based financial products will only be one more obstacle to the separation of Money and State.

Bitcoin aims to separate Money and the State.

Do not forget it.

Mass adoption will start when the general public understands that these financial products are just a lure used by the powerful at the head of the current system to try to distract them from the real purpose of the Bitcoin revolution.

Your interest in Bitcoin lies in taking power over the fruit of your labor and your life.

This therefore involves understanding the why of Bitcoin, understanding why you need self-custody, understanding why you need to run a node on the Bitcoin network, ...

In short, this means you need to understand that Bitcoin is much more than just another financial investment!

All of this is much more interesting than spending your day raving about the trading volumes of financial products within a flawed and unfixable system.

A debt-based system which is at the root of the majority of the ills of our society. A system that imposes constant censorship on you and which has impoverished you a little more every day for decades.

Bitcoin drops below $20,000

Over the weekend, bitcoin dropped below a key psychological level for buyer support, and so far has not been able to get back above it. The bitcoin ([BTC-USD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD?p=BTC-USD&.tsrc=fin-srch)) price fell below $20,000 on Saturday and is trading at $19,379 on Sunday morning, a loss of 29.36% over the past week. It briefly slipped below $18,000 on Saturday afternoon, but the price so far has rallied 1.18% over the past 24 hours. Ether ([ETH-USD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ETH-USD?p=ETH-USD&.tsrc=fin-srch)), which is more intertwined with crypto‚Äôs DeFi segment that has lately wrecked havoc on the risk management strategies of significant industry players, is trading at $1,039 per coin, a loss of almost 29% in the last week. On Saturday, its price dipped below $900 before bouncing back.

I've held through all the crashes. Who's laughing now? Not the panic sellers.

Market is all about moving money from impatient to the patient. You see crash, I see opportunity.

You - OMG Bitcoin is crashing, I gotta sell!

Me - OMG Bitcoin is criminally undervalued, I gotta buy!

N.B. Word to the wise for new investors. What I've learned over 7 years is that whenever it crashes spectacularly, the bounce is twice as impactful and record-setting. I can't predict the bottom but I can assure you that it WILL hit 19k and go further beyond, as hard as it may be for a lot of folks to believe right at this moment if you haven't been through it before.

When Bitcoin was at ATH little over a month ago, people were saying, 'it's too pricey now, I can't buy'.

Well, here's your chance at almost 60% discount!

Due Diligence on Bitcoin,2021-03-03 21:26:57,"Hi everyone,

I've been trying to evaluate on my own whether bitcoin is worth buying and holding long term and wanted to present to you some basic findings. This is not financial advice but my own research analysis and I am open to being corrected as I am still new. I see a lot of DD for stocks but not as much here so I am hoping we can also get some more quality content here to share knowledge. I am someone who has bought and sold bitcoin at a loss back in 2017-2018, and then again 2020-2021. Yes, I saw all the ""HODL"" posts, but I was only in it for attempted financial gain. I've only recently spent the time to look into bitcoin and become a believer.

**Supply**: First, Bitcoin has a fixed supply. Right now there are 900 bitcoins mined per day. Every four years the number of Bitcoins produced per block (created every 10 minutes) are cut in half. Currently the mining reward is 6.25 Bitcoin per block. In 2024 it will drop to 3.125 BTC per block. So we are beginning to see something we learned in our high school Economics class called Scarcity.

[https:\/\/institutional.fidelity.com\/app\/literature\/item\/9901337.html?pos=T](https://preview.redd.it/xqveh5ei8vk61.png?width=359&format=png&auto=webp&s=eff083c195e1aa24ede9ce998708f1d2c0f53f83)

**Demand**: Next is demand. It doesn't matter if there's less of a resource no one wants. There is a lot to look at here (i.e. Bitcoin ATM installations increased by +85% in 2020 to 11,798 terminals, outpacing the previous year‚Äôs near +50% rise by a significant margin, according to data source Coin ATM Radar). But the big one we are all most excited about is the change in institutional money flowing in. For those that don't know Metcalfe‚Äôs Law, it holds that as the number of its users grows linearly, a network‚Äôs value (or, by inference, the bitcoin price) grows geometrically. In other words, there is a cascading effect where more and more institutions begin exponentially buying in *worldwide*. Right now 30% of all U.S. buyers are institutions. This is a big deal because institutions have more money than you, and that means if they keep buying, our clock window to buy at our current price is now ticking.

[https:\/\/ir.citi.com\/peFJTnzeEoMSIAEFlwH12VeM5d&#37;2BCckWNrsO9lxpmyWezrz5V&#37;2Bx&#37;2FfRvm0gv6cWRpDHGWtIk7sTME&#37;3D](https://preview.redd.it/wc54qsbk7vk61.png?width=456&format=png&auto=webp&s=b468d4499be43c05390432d4e0bd7a578b79d0b7)

**Indicators**: The first decade was marked by speculation and pushback. And Bitcoin prices reflected that. I know for a lot of us, me included, we want indicators to show that prices will go up. But something I'd like to propose for your consideration also: The maturation of an ecosystem tends to result in fresh consolidation. Because we are still in a stage of Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD), this is good news for you - it means we are only now beginning to exit the early adaptor stage. It's not too late to buy. As more and more people have bitcoin, it will begin its slow inevitable march towards mainstream as a dependable store of value. This is why the next chart I want to show you is not just money, but people. More and more people are bitcoin owners. More and more people start talking and googling and investing. Metcalfe‚Äôs Law, remember?

[https:\/\/www.lookintobitcoin.com\/charts\/wallets-greater-than-1-btc\/](https://preview.redd.it/ndk2uz1t7vk61.png?width=1117&format=png&auto=webp&s=34386a60c29ff9950d506a7899030441a4220200)

**Inflation/Depreciation**: When I was a kid I remember reading a book called ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" where the premise was to put your money in assets that make more money, not less. Putting your money in things that depreciate (i.e. a car) loses you money over time, while things that appreciate (i.e. a house) make more money. A popular Bitcoin valuation chart is called the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) pricing model. Notice how as Bitcoin becomes more scarce due to halving's, it exponentially grows. Next, notice how your hard earned U.S. Dollar has depreciated by 99% the past hundred years to gold, which has been traditionally the ""gold standard"" of storage. Guys, this is seriously starting to look like a no brainer to me.

**Regulation**: This something not completely known to any of us. Despite the price volatility, what if the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and Securities or Exchange Commission (SEC) tried to in some way limit or outright ban Bitcoin? I take comfort that institutions are adopting and even big retail investors are adding Bitcoin as part of their overall asset portfolio. Regulation is not always bad and can provide us a layer security from a ""Mt. Gox"" happening to us again. There is a stable coin called Tether that is being investigated and other legitimate FUD concerns. But with Coinbase's soon IPO, and large positions on the news from the likes of Tesla, there is more safety and certainty. Do understand that your faith is currently paid to you at a premium. Once all FUD and volatility from Bitcoin is removed, it's skyrocketing price will reflect that.

[In December 2020, the SEC announced they would allow ‚Äúcrypto-focused broker-dealers to operate for five years without fear of an enforcement action provided that they can verify if they have possession and control of customers‚Äô digital asset securities https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/rules\/policy\/2020\/34-90788.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/gfyk4m81mvk61.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=a957eec2e5367ad36acf68cd26e6d320f9818477)

**Competition**: Cryptocurrency is not just limited to Bitcoin, there are many ""altcoins."" But analysts have been pointing to Bitcoin as the ""north star"" of all other cryptocurrencies and welcome mainstream adaption of cryptocurrencies as a portfolio diversifier. Bitcoin helps illuminate the financial industry‚Äôs path. There are new technologies and advancements being made too for the ""inefficiencies"" of Bitcoin. Efforts to improve Bitcoin‚Äôs processing speed are underway such as a new scaling technology called the Lightning Network.

**Conclusion**: Bitcoin has gone mainstream and is considered a legitimate asset class of digital gold by more and more investors. Bitcoin has a proven supply dynamic (S2F) and demand dynamic (Metcalfe‚Äôs Law). With banks printing money to infinity, the question for you is:

*With all this information, is bitcoin worth a portion of your portfolio?*

If your answer is ""*yes*"" then Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) of buying and holding bitcoin appears to be a viable investment. I do not think this is an asset class to sell anymore. Notice nowhere in this writeup did I talk about getting rich quick off bitcoin's prices. I'm a firm believer that ""time in the market beats timing the market,"" and so I will be buying and holding because I believe in the future of bitcoin.

Powell spoke and the stock market expects less inflation rate hikes in 2023. Shorts are closing even in the stock market and relief is on the street.

There is a solid chance for a July like bear market rally if CPI turns out good enough.

Why I changed my mind about Bitcoin,2021-05-06 13:43:11," For the last two years, my small business has been put on hold due to covid. I had spare cash and decided I wanted to look into investing instead of letting the money sit there so I did some research. To clarify, I was completely new to this until September.

I NEVER thought I'd be buying into crypto. Cryptos just seemed far too complicated - I didn't understand any of it because, along with bitcoin, you're thrown 100 other crypto coins or tokens that do other things and it just wasn't easy to get into.

I don't feel the community of people into cryptos ever truly explained why you should buy fake internet currency or what it does. Being told Bitcoin is 'decentralised' and 'deflationary' meant nothing to me. 

I thought, how does that provide use or value? This seems like one big pyramid scheme of a huge community promising the price will keep going up because 'there are only 21m Bitcoins and 7bil people' just made me think there's a huge bubble that will burst like all the times before and I'll be the one holding the bag. 

It wasn't until I found **SIMPLE** reasons - *that I had to dig for* \- as to **WHY** that made me change my perspective completely.

So, here are the things that convinced me.

Bitcoin isn't about making money off an investment. The reason for Bitcoin isn't about getting in early, the value goes up and then selling. If you look at it like that, there's no point investing.

Bitcoin is an alternative - better - performing currency. It can be used anywhere in the world better than our current financial system. 

Bitcoin is a faster, global, one currency for all. It can be turned from Bitcoin into any currency in a few minutes and visa versa.

Stored online or offline by your phone, computer or ledger wallet (like a USB). It can be accessed anywhere at any time. Everything is backed up by a unique seed phrase in case you lose your wallet. Everything is VERY easy to use and access.

Bitcoin holders are their own banks. Imagine a relative has an emergency in another county and needs money. Normally, this would take 1-3 working days to transfer due to banking networks. 

With Bitcoin, you would transfer your bitcoin to their wallet and they could instantly change this into their local currency within 10 minutes. No heavy exchange rate. No waiting. No forms. No long back and forth of bank details, account numbers, sort codes, swift numbers etc. Any day, anytime. 

Bitcoin is actually easy to use. Receiving bitcoin into your wallet address and sending it to other wallet addresses. Simple. 

The value comes from Bitcoin being the new age of currency. Governments can ruin their *own* economy by printing their *own* currency and cause hyperinflation. The more they print, the poorer their *own* people become. Obvious examples are Zimbabwe and Turkey. However, this also applies globally. One in five US Dollars were created in 2020. This means your money is worth less through no fault of your own. 

Imagine being in Zimbabwe during their worst financial crisis. People had no option but to watch their entire life savings turn to ashes because of their government. Bitcoin can provide financial stability on a global scale.

So for now, I have put a large portion into bitcoin. Not for an investment but what I feel is the future of financial freedom. I now see why people are believing in and buying bitcoin and don't feel like it's bad idea at all. 

Please note, I'm not trying to raise the price of Bitcoin (I don't think my reddit post will have an impact on trillion-dollar market cap currency) but show awareness to the average-joe who may not be aware of why this thing exists and why it is gaining such a massive following.",0.9232,Positive

On December 4, 1921, The New York Tribune published a story detailing a plan by inventor Henry Ford, founder of the Ford Motor Company, to replace the existing gold-backed currency system into one based on an ‚Äúenergy currency.‚Äù 

Ford goes on to say ‚ÄúUnder the energy currency system the standard would be a certain amount of energy exerted for one hour that would be equal to USD 1. It‚Äôs simply a case of thinking and calculating in terms different from those laid down to us by the international banking group to which we have grown so accustomed that we think there is no other desirable standard.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThe essential evil of gold in its relation to war is the fact that it can be controlled. Break the control and you stop war.‚Äù

/r/Bitcoin FAQ - Newcomers please read,2017-06-26 15:13:26,"# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Sticky FAQ

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

The following videos are a good starting point for understanding how bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

* [Video 1: What Is Bitcoin & Why Should You Care?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKSQdhxnvCc)
* [Video 2: The real value of bitcoin and crypto currency technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIVAluSL9SU&index=1&list=FLqnDHJBl3xGTosMjyXc4-0A)
* [Video 3: Bitcoin Is Independent Money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzFOwFXlR48)
* [Video 4: Bitcoin 101 - Balaji Srinivasan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIxwTx7o_B4)

For some more great introductory videos check out [Andreas Antonopoulos's YouTube playlists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkxdys-Ek9U), he is probably the best bitcoin educator out there today.   Also have to give mention to James D'Angelo's [Bitcoin 101 Blackboard series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhe61JaNFLU&index=6&list=PLzctEq7iZD-7-DgJM604zsndMapn9ff6q).

**Key properties of bitcoin**

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be 21,000,000 bitcoins created and they are issued in a predictable fashion, you can view the inflation schedule [here](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The halving countdown can be found [here](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/).
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read the source code yourself [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin).
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockexplorer.com/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoins reside has the authority to move them.
* **Low fee** - Transactions fees can vary between a few cents and a few dollars depending on network demand and how much priority you wish to assign to the transaction. 
 Most wallets calculate the fee automatically but you can view current fees [here](https://bitcoinfees.21.co/).
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](http://bitcoinglobe.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](http://bitcoinsimplified.org/learn-more/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Encrypted cryptographically and can‚Äôt be [brute forced](https://miguelmoreno.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds to a [few minutes](https://blockchain.info/charts/avg-confirmation-time) depending on need for confirmations.  After a few confirmations transactions are irreversible.  
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries with a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer).
* **Portable** - Bitcoins are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can even be transported by simply [remembering a string of words](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) for wallet recovery.
* **Scalable** - Each bitcoin is [divisible down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability) allowing it to grow in value while still accommodating micro-transactions.
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat

## Where can I buy bitcoins?

[BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) and [Howtobuybitcoin.io](https://howtobuybitcoin.io/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular resources are below, also, check out the [bitcoinity exchange resources](https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/exchanges/USD/30d) for a larger list of options for purchases.

[Here](http://coinatmradar.com/) is a listing of local ATMs.  If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Cashila](https://www.cashila.com/) or [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoins are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitfinex/btcusd/1hr) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. [Preev](http://preev.com/btc/usd) is a useful site that  that shows how much various denominations of bitcoin are worth in different currencies. Alternatively you can just Google ""1 bitcoin in (your local currency)"".

## Securing your bitcoins

With bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoins **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold the bitcoins for you.


* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, there are many software wallet options [here](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet).  If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn computer security best practices, then a hardware wallet such as the [Trezor](https://www.bitcointrezor.com/) or [Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/) is recommended.  A more advanced option is to secure them yourself using [paper wallets](https://bitcoinpaperwallet.com/) generated offline.  Some popular mobile and desktop options are listed below and most are cross platform.  

Android | iOs | Desktop
--------------------|-----|-----
[Mycelium](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet)  | [BreadWallet](https://itunes.apple.com/app/breadwallet/id885251393) | [Electrum](https://electrum.org/#home)
[CoPay](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitpay.copay&hl=en) | [AirBitz](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bitcoin-wallet-map-directory/id843536046?mt=8) | [Armory](https://btcarmory.com/)

* If you prefer to let third party **""Bitcoin banks""** manage your coins, try [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) or [Xapo](https://xapo.com/) but be aware you may not be in control of your private keys in which case you would have to ask permission to access your funds and be exposed to third party risk.  

Another interesting use case for physical storage/transfer is the [Opendime](https://opendime.com/).  Opendime is a small USB stick that allows you to spend Bitcoin by physically passing it along so it's anonymous and tangible like cash.  

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code to access your account, usually from a text message or app, making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoins can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](http://folding.stanford.edu/).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read more [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions you can [run a full node](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/features/) using [this setup guide](https://medium.com/@lopp/how-to-set-up-a-bitcoin-full-node-2dd1c09763d3). [Bitseed](https://bitseed.org/) is an easy option for getting set up.  You can view the global node distribution [here](https://getaddr.bitnodes.io/).

## Earning bitcoins

Just like any other form of money, you can also earn bitcoins by being paid to do a job.

## Bitcoin Units

One Bitcoin is quite large (hundreds of ¬£/$/‚Ç¨) so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | SI unit for milli i.e. millilitre (mL) or millimetre (mm)
microbitcoin | ŒºBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | SI unit for micro i.e microlitre (ŒºL) or micrometre (Œºm)
bit |bit| 1,000,000 per bitcoin| Colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi |sat| 100,000,000 per bitcoin| Smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $500 for one Bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.02 BTC
* 20 mBTC
* 20,000 bits

For more information check out the [Bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

"I'm not buying Bitcoin because I want more USD, I'm buying Bitcoin because I DON'T WANT USD",2023-12-18 23:57:42,"I've had family members ask me if I'll sell when it hits $100,000 or whatever. And I respond by saying I'll never sell. They responded with, ""why would you never sell? What's the point? Don't you ever wanna live life?"" So I have to clarify, I will never *sell for USD*, because I don't want USD. When I feel like it, I'll use my Bitcoin to *buy* items I want, like a home, car, vacation, stocks, etc. And if I need to use USD as a medium in order to do that, then I guess I'll sell for USD to then buy the item I want.

That's the conviction that so many people have with Bitcoin. We're not buying it to get more USD, we're buying it to get out of the USD system. Just some perspective, in case some have also been confused by the thought of others saying they'll ""never sell.""

Bitcoin is the Broccoli of this sub,2022-02-03 21:16:16,"You know Broccoli won't hurt you. On the contrary, it would be very very healthy to eat broccoli more often.

Instead, you keep reaching for one of the thousands of sweets that seem so delicious. They have such interesting names and the packaging says all sorts of great things. When you're out shopping, you just can't avoid putting them in your cart.

The sweets can satisfy your cravings much better than the boring broccoli. You know that could hurt you. Obesity or diabetes but you need that quick dopamine rush.

So guys, stay healthy and brush your teeth properly. Tooth decay is no joke.

Don't buy Bitcoin.,2021-05-26 00:17:20,"- Go to school 12 years;
- Get a loan to pay university that you might take a lifetime to pay;
- Get a job 9-5;
- Get a loan to buy a house that you might take a lifetime to pay;
- Do a 401k or something similar in order to prepare your retirement;
- Pay your taxes and bills quietly;
- Give the extra 15$ that you spare per month to a bank, bankers are our friends and will make you earn good interests;

But! Whatever you do, don't buy Bitcoin! Bitcoin is risky and volatile and it's used by criminals and terrorists and consumes almost all the energy of the world. You might lose all your money. It has no value whatsoever, it's backed by nothing and can't be used in anything. 

TL;DR: you might look the keys for your schakles all life long, only to find they were in your pocket since the beginning.


EDIT: Guys, this is a ironic post, thought it was pretty clear but saw in comments some people thinking otherwise. It was just a funny but true way of exposing how I think the world sees Bitcoin. And, of course, this is not financial advice. Want one advice? Never follow a stranger's advice. Love you all.

Millennials Love Bitcoin And Hate Stocks,2018-02-08 11:36:42,,0.0,Neutral
Bitcoin is not the new gold,2022-02-24 15:10:17,"While today is only one day, I think that it pretty dramatically shows that bitcoin is not the new gold, as a lot of its proponents claim. As of 10am EST this morning, bitcoin is down about 7% while gold is up about 2%. Something like a Russian attack on Ukraine is what people have in mind when thinking about a black swan-type event, but bitcoin has only magnified losses. 

Instead of acting like an uncorrelated asset, bitcoin basically just acts like a super high-beta tech stock. Not saying anything about what will make anyone more money going forward, but I think any rationale to have bitcoin to improve portfolio diversification is mostly a fiction.


Edit: the time is now 355pm EST, and stock markets, bitcoin, and gold have dramatically reversed this afternoon (SPY +1.5%, QQQ +%3, BTC +%2%, gold -0.5%). This basically just proves my point. The point isn't that bitcoin will not make money in the future (it might, I have no idea), the point is that bitcoin is very correlated with tech stocks instead of being an uncorrelated asset like gold. The action today reinforces that idea.",0.9432,Positive
